# Project Manager CLI

Project Manager is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline project management, allowing you to swiftly navigate between different projects.

## Installation

### npm

```bash
npm install -g Nitestack/project-manager
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn add -g project-manager@Nitestack/project-manager
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm add -g Nitestack/project-manager
```

### bun

```bash
bun add -g git@github.com:Nitestack/project-manager.git
```

I have opted not to publish this tool on the npm registry. Given its nature as a compact CLI tool, I have decided to spare users and myself from the intricacies associated with npm publishing. Installation instructions for various package managers are provided above.

## Usage

To get started, run the following command:

```bash
pm --help
```

This command triggers an interactive setup guide to help configure the project manager according to your preferences.

For assistance and information about the CLI, run the following command:

Wishing you seamless project management!
